# LTSpice-Analog-Entropy-Override-Controller
Hybrid analog–digital FSM override circuit for real-time entropy-triggered pipeline control — modeled in LTSpice.

🧠 Purpose
This circuit implements analog logic gates, comparators, and pulse generation to simulate a chaos-aware hazard response unit. It integrates entropy signals, transient noise, and machine learning (ML) trigger cues to drive three control outcomes: LOCK_OUT, FLUSH_OUT, and internal transition behavior.

⚙️ Features
Subsystem	Function
V_entropy	Models entropy signal — filtered via RC and fed to comparator
LOCK_OUT	Asserted when entropy is high AND ML trigger is high
V_noise	Simulates high-frequency transient noise
FLUSH_OUT	Issued as a pulse after comparator detects noise threshold crossing
ML Trigger Logic	Combines ml_trigger with entropy via analog NAND to issue LOCK signal
Inverter & NAND	Logic-level conversions for interfacing analog comparator outputs

🔍 Components Breakdown
OP07 Comparators: Precision analog thresholds

RC Filters & Diodes: Smooth + shape transient responses

CD4007 CMOS Inverters: Digital pulse cleanup

NAND Logic Chain: Ensures coordinated hazard triggering

PWL Sources: Testbench inputs for entropy, noise, and ML-trigger simulation

🧪 Expected Behavior
LOCK_OUT triggers when:

V_entropy > 3.3V AND

ml_trigger = 1V

FLUSH_OUT emits a short pulse when:

V_noise > 2V triggers a comparator edge

Full simulation expected to visualize LOCK escalation, FLUSH response time, and logic path cleanliness.
